# Savor

## Description

Savor is a recipe app where you can post your favorite recipes and save recipes from other user's. You can add comments of your experiences and tips for other chef's on each recipe too. With each recipe, you can post a photo of it so other chef's can get an idea of how it will come out. 

## Setup

To access Savor, please visit savor.onrender.com. Note that it may take up to one minute for the intital load up, but after that everything should work fine. You can make an account, or use the login 'janedoe@gmail.com' with the password 'helloworld'. Please feel free to add your own recipes and save any of your favorites. The Banana Bread is my favorite and I make it regularly for my friends and family. 

## Technologies
Savor was created with a React front-end and a Ruby back-end utilizing active record. Savor uses AWS and Ruby's active storage for image hosting. Redux is used for state management on the front-end.

## Considerations

I did not write all of these recipes myself.
